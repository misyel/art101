	<h1>Lab 4: Psuedocoding and Problem Solving 🦀</h1>
	<h2>⭐️ Subject</h2>
	<div class="card">
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to psuedocode everyday tasks and computer tasks and build a habit of psuedocoding
			before coding.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h2>😵‍💫 Challenges</h2>
	<div class="card">
		<p>
			It was fairly challenging to break down topics into smaller ideas or chunks for the psuedocode and we had a bit
			of trouble insertting the js into the html.
